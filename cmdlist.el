;;; Commentary:

;; The idea is to maintain a global file with all the latex commands
;; you like to use. This package then provides tools to maintain that
;; file and automatically update your latex files based on it.

;; There is now also functionality which automatically adds
;; "usepackage" statements based on a global file listing which
;; packages provide which commands.

;; There are several convenience functions, most of which are listed
;; in the example keybindings below. The most import one is
;; cmdlist-conditional-update-latex-buffer. See the documentation of
;; those functions for more info, as well as the customization
;; variables below under "Variables".

;; Also see README.md (presently available at
;; https://github.com/jojhelfer/cmdlist.el) for more information.

;; My keybindings:

;; (evil-define-key 'normal LaTeX-mode-map
;;   (kbd "SPC d c") 'cmdlist-update-save-and-compile
;;   (kbd "SPC g u") 'cmdlist-conditional-update-buffer
;;   (kbd "SPC g c") 'cmdlist-generate-and-add-cmd
;;   (kbd "SPC g a") 'cmdlist-add-cmd-to-file
;;   (kbd "SPC g r") 'cmdlist-generate-mathrm
;;   (kbd "SPC g b") 'cmdlist-generate-mathbf
;;   (kbd "SPC g B") 'cmdlist-generate-mathbb
;;   (kbd "SPC g C") 'cmdlist-generate-mathcal
;;   (kbd "SPC g F") 'cmdlist-generate-mathfrak
;;   (kbd "SPC g o") 'cmdlist-generate-operatorname
;;   (kbd "SPC g p") 'cmdlist-generate-package
;;   (kbd "SPC g z") 'cmdlist-delete-unused-newcmds
;;   (kbd "SPC g f") 'cmdlist-open-cmdlist-file)

;; TODO Look into just parsing the whole file, hopefully with some pre-existing tool. In particular, look into AucTeX's TeX-auto-file, TeX-auto-save, etc. We should also use TeX-find-macro-start and TeX-find-macro-end (and TeX-current-macro, etc.)
;; TODO Add commands to clean unused packages
;; TODO Try to guess command provider by looking through package/class files
;; TODO Ignore commands used in comments
;; TODO Be careful about commands (and packages) which are the empty string
;; TODO Add \usetikzlibrary support
;; TODO Add option to (via elisp) allow presence of certain commands to trigger insertion of arbitrary code in preamble
